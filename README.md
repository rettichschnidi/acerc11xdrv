About acerc11xdrv
=================
The aim of this project was to reverse engineer the protocol of the
Acer C110 pico projector and to deliver a Linux driver. 

However, the driver was never more than a prototype and based on the
published format, Antonio Ospite wrote a driver, which is superior in
any way: http://git.ao2.it/libam7xxx.git/
